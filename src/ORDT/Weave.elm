{-| Weaves are collections specifically designed to handle wefts and operations. They keep causality
information about events in a distributed system, and offer some methods to replicate, `merge` and
edit parts of the history.

The site identifiers can be any comparable type. This includes `Int`, `Float`, `Time`, `Char`,
`String`, and tuples or lists of comparable types.

Internally, some implicit references will be added if necessary, for transitive acknowledgements or
acknowledgements of the previous operations of this site. If you add at a certain `site`, the index
for this particular site will use `max(get weft site, nextWeaveIndexFor site)`.
